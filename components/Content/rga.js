        `Spreadsheets are great for storing and visualizing data.`,
        `It turns out that when we need to run a heuristic evaluation, using a smartphone, tablet or even a laptop, it is quite difficult to manually enter data into these spreadsheets. Especially when there are many columns.`,
        `Because of that, I created and developed a specific app (mobile and desktop) so that the UX evaluators could collect and save the observed data during the analysis.`,
        `The app (in MVP) allows you not only to insert the heuristic score, but also to insert comments, paste a link with screenshots, and even insert extra findings that can be classified as Good, Bad or Neutral.`,
        `Now the data is exposed in a much easier to read way. In addition, entering the collected data has become much simpler and frictionless.`,
        `Another advantage is that the color classification of extra finds is now fully automated. All of this cut data collection time by almost half.`,
